      <p>You think you know teachers? Think again. Ms. Reynolds doesn’t just grade papers — she grades runways. When school's out, she’s jetting solo to some foreign country you've probably never heard of, casually navigating new cultures while the rest of us are still trying to figure out Google Maps.

<br><br>She doesn’t eat chocolate (yeah, we were shocked too), but her dog? Total diva. Follows her around like she’s the Queen of England.

<br><br>She’s got a sense of humor sharper than your pencil and timing better than your class excuses. If she had a catchphrase, it’d probably be something like, “Pop quiz? I am the pop quiz.”

<br><br>Don’t be fooled, she may have a seating chart, but she’s full of surprises.</p>
